This repo, "GettingAndCleaningDataCoursera", contains my Course Project submission for the Coursera "Getting and Cleaning Data" course (https://www.coursera.org/course/getdata). Included are: 1) my R script, "run_analysis.R", that generates a tidy data set from the starting data, provided that the starting data (available at https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip) is in the user's working directory and has already been unzipped. 2) a code book, "CodeBook.md" that describes the data, the data cleaning and transformations, and the variables. 3) this README file.
